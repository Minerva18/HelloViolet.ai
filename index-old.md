Voice skills today are very limited - primarily supporting basic
'Command-Response' type usage. Violet lets you take the next step. Build basic
skills with ease, and supercharge your Voice Applications to get answers from
users and even provide coaching as needed.

## Basics

Violet is a Node.js framework that allows you to create voice-scripts in an
intuitive manner, while consisting of a set of plugins to hide low-level API
calls. Conversations can be tested locally using its web interface, and are
typically deployed on Amazon's Alex API.


### violet-conversations

This is the core module used by any of the Violet projects. Tools are provided
so that scripts built here can be easily tested using a Web-UI, as well as
an interface to ease skill registration.

### violet-samples

These are built-out samples that are provided so that you can easily examine,
customize, and/or create your own scripts.

## Questions
Please reach out on Stack Overflow, Twitter, or file a bug on the appropriate
project.
