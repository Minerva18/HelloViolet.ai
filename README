Violet website pulling in documentation from the different Violet projects.

Two branches:
- master: source files and scripts to generate the website
- gh-pages: content used by github-pages to host the site

Can be updated by making sure that the other violet projects are siblings to
this project, as well as an extra copy of this repository with the gh-pages
branch checkedout, with all repositories updated, and then typing:
  rm -rf ../HelloViolet.ai-gh/docs; jsdoc -c _jsdoc/conf.json

Caution: Currently sources for Jekyll are in both master and gh-pages
branches (other files should only be in one branch of the other).
