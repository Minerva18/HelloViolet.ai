This week has been a busy week for us. We got the final go ahead for open sourcing Violet and answered a lot of questions about it at Dreamforce. The feedback has been incredible and we are looking forward to seeing what people build from here.

The road to Open Sourcing has fortunately for us been a fairly straight-forward path - in large parts thanks to guidance from our Open Source Ambassador - [James Ward](https://twitter.com/_JamesWard). This has really meant that we gradually opened up our code to larger and larger groups while hearing about thoughts, challenges, and use cases - and at the same time maturing our code base by adding documentation, simplifying usage, and adding automated tests.
