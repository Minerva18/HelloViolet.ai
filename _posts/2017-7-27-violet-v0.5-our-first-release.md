In our quest towards enabling others to build great Voice experiences a key goal of ours is to share our work. We therefore would like to get Violet to be used by more than just our team and today we have made the first release of Violet.

Beyond improved documentation this release has a number of highlights:
* We have significantly updated support for loading and storing data in Salesforce. We have added support for updating fields (thanks to Gina Nguyenâ€‹). Custom objects/fields are now assumed to be the default and native objects/fields are indicated with a `*`. We have also added examples and test cases for working with the Case object.
* All of the experimental features in Violet now need to be explicitly enabled (by calling the right methods or loading the modules). Violet started with us trying to do too many intelligent things automatically which caused confusion among users.
